\title{Technology to aid the analysis of large-volume multi-institute climate model output at a Central Analysis Facility (PRIMAVERA Data Management Tool V2.10)}
\maketitle
We would like to thank the three reviewers for theirs efforts to make their thoughtful and constructive comments, which we believe have helped to improve the manuscript. We have implemented their suggestions and our responses to each comment are listed below.

\section{RC1}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The title} The manuscript's title has been changed slightly to emphasise that the paper talks about the technology rather than the analysis. The new title is ``Technology to aid the analysis of large-volume multi-institute climate model output at a Central Analysis Facility (PRIMAVERA Data Management Tool V2.10)``.

\item \textbf{Page 2, lines 4-7} Hopefully, the flow has been improved.

\item \textbf{Page 2, line 26} Additional information about the compute has been added.

\item \textbf{Page 6, line 3} A clarification has been added to say that 440~TiB was the maximum available to the project.

\item \textbf{Page 8, lines 3-4} The decription of process has been elaborated on to hopefully allow future projects to work more efficiently. 

\item \textbf{Page 9, first paragraph} The terminology was misleading. ``unique'' has been removed as the text already includes the phrase ``... at least once...'', which means the same as unique. 

\item \textbf{Page 9, first paragraph} More information about purge policies, priorities and demand management have been added to a new paragraph at the end of this section.

\item \textbf{Page 9, second paragraph} Jupyter notebooks were used and these have been added to the list of tools that are mentioned.

\item \textbf{Page 9, line 15} A response rate has been added.

\item \textbf{Page 10, first paragraph}  Use of JASMIN by our African partners is very much in its infancy and further work is required but I have added one example that we have used so far.
\end{itemize}

\section{RC2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Portability} A new Sect. 5.2 titled "Design Considerations" has been added, which includes a discussion on how generalisable the current version of the DMT is to other institutions.
	 
\item \textbf{Design} The new Sect. 5.2 titled "Design Considerations" discusses how the requirements for the DMT were developed and the design methodology used along with some pitfalls that should improved on in a future version.

\end{itemize}
