\begin{abstract}
The PRIMAVERA project aims to develop a new generation of advanced and well-evaluated high-resolution global climate models. PRIMAVERA's Stream 1 simulations consist of seven different climate models being run at a standard and a higher resolution with common initial conditions and forcings to form a multi-model ensemble. The ensemble members were run a set of high performance computers across Europe. To allow the data from all models to be analysed it was transferred to the JASMIN super-data-cluster. At JASMIN the data was catalogued and details made available to users in the Data Management Tool (DMT). Users from across the project were able to query the available data using the DMT and to then login to JASMIN to analyse the data. Here we describe how the PRIMAVERA project used JASMIN's facilities to enable users to analyse this multi-model data set. We show how a facility such as JASMIN can be useful for other collaborative projects.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

The PRIMAVERA project aims to develop a new generation of advanced and well-evaluated high-resolution global climate models. One of PRIMAVERA's core components are the Stream 1 and Stream 2 simulations. These simulations consist of seven different climate models (AWI-CM-1-1, CMCC-CM2, CNRM-CM6-1, EC-Earth3P, ECMWF-IFS, HadGEM3-GC31 and MPI-ESM1-2) being run at their standard resolution (typically  250~km in the atmosphere and 100~km in the ocean) and at a higher resolution (25~km atmosphere and 8-25~km ocean). All models are run with common initial conditions and forcings using the HighResMIP protocol \citep{Haarsma2016}. The simulations were run on high performance computers (HPCs) across Europe. The scientists analysing the model outputs are based at 20 different institutes across Europe with assistance from other global scientists. Because these are global simulations at a high resolution, the total volume of data is expected to be around 1.6~petabytes (PB).

In the planning for PRIMAVERA a Data Management Plan (DMP) was developed to allow this data to be stored, analysed and archived. The JASMIN super-data-cluster was selected for this purpose. The Data Management Tool (DMT) software was developed to implement the DMP. 

\section{JASMIN}

JASMIN is a super-data-cluster that was first installed in 2012 \cite{lawrence2013storing}. It is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the UK Space Agency. JASMIN is operated by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). It is located at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Lab, Harwell, UK. JASMIN's Phase 4 update in September 2018 added 38.5~PB of storage co-located with the existing over 4000 cores of compute all of which is tied together with a low latency network. RAL has a fast connection to JANET, the UK's academic network, which in turn is connected to the G\'{E}ANT European network, allowing fast transfer of data from HPCs to JASMIN. JASMIN additionally has access to RAL's tape library for offline storage of data.

The compute at JASMIN is split into interactive data analysis servers, the LOTUS batch processing system and some additional private cloud servers. Part of the storage is dedicated for the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) archive. The storage for individual projects is split into small chunks called group workspaces (GWS). 

\section{PRIMAVERA}

PRIMAVERA consists of eleven work packages (WPs). The Stream 1 and 2 simulations described here are produced and managed by two of the work packages. Several of the other WPs analyse these simulations and compare them and also compare them against existing simulations. The remaining WPs are carrying out model development work or running small simulations that don't need to be shared with other WPs. These remaining WPs had a small volume of storage on one of the GWS reserved for them. 

The Stream 1 and 2 simulations follow the HighResMIP protocol and will be submitted to the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) \citep{Eyring2016}. The Stream 1 simulations consisted of a single ensemble from member at standard and high resolution from each climate model. As a result of the first analysis of the Stream 1 simulations it was decided that a component of Stream 2 should be additional ensemble members from some of Stream 1 models, but with a reduced data output to minimise the volume of data generated.

\section{Data Management Plan}

% does D9.1 on the external webpage need adding to zenodo so that it can be referenced?



\subsection{JASMIN Resources Allocated}

As a result of the DMP, PRIMAVERA was allocated 440 terabytes (TB) of storage split into 5 GWS. A server in the JASMIN internal cloud was allocated, which was given the domain name prima-dm.ceda.ac.uk and HTTPS access from outside of JASMIN was granted to it.

%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures

\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
